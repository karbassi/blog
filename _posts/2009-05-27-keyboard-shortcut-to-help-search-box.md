If you haven't figured out how Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) help search box allows you to search menu items, check out [Chris Pirillo demoing the feature].

The problem for me is that I'm a keyboard person. Over 90% of my day, I barely touch the mouse. Now, to get to the help search bar with your keyboard, just press:

`⌘ (Command) + ⇧ (Shift) + ? (Question Mark)`
