Recently I've giving "Glims":http://www.machangout.com/ a try. Even though it *tries* to combine what Inquisitor and Saft both do into one single free application, I was very disappointed in the ease of use and look.

Before trying Glims, I had to uninstall (remove) "Inquisitor":http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/ that was already running on my version of "Webkit":http://www.webkit.org and Safari. To do this, I opened up terminal and typed the following commands (with my password that is):

{% highlight bash %}
sudo rm -rf /Library/InputManagers/Inquisitor/
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/inquisitor*
sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Inquisitor/
{% endhighlight %}

After couple hours of use, I wanted to switch back to Inquisitor, which meant that I had to remove Glims. To do that action, I pulled up terminal, yet again, and typed the follow:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo rm -rf /Library/InputManagers/Glims/
sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Glims/
{% endhighlight %}

That should take care of everything, leaving my computer nice and clean.
