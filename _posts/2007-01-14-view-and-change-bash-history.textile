title: "View and Change bash history"

Always wanted to know what you have been doing via bash? Did you know bash keeps a history of that? Here is a quick way to check it and an easy way to change the history limit.

First open up a @terminal@ by going to @Applications > Accessories > Terminal@ (in Ubuntu) or press @Alt + F2@ and type in @terminal@. Now that you have a terminal open, let's get down to viewing your history.

To view your history via the terminal, type:

{% highlight bash %}
history
{% endhighlight %}

This will show the whole list.

To view your history in a editor (to save for later), just type:

{% highlight bash %}
history -w ~/history.txt
gedit ~/history.txt
{% endhighlight %}

What @history -w ~/history.txt@ does is save the @history@ to a file named @history.txt@ on your home folder (@cd ~/@). The next command opens up the file for viewing in @gedit@.

*Note:* For more information about @history@ be sure to use the man pages by doing:

{% highlight bash %}
man history
{% endhighlight %}

Now to change your bash history length, just open up your @.bashrc@ by doing so:

{% highlight bash %}
gedit ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

Once open, at the top add.

{% highlight bash %}
export HISTFILESIZE=3000
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the limit can be changed.

Bash keeps it's own history in a file. You can view that file as stated before, or by opening @~./bash_history@
