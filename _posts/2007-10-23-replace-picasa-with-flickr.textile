title: "Replace Picasa with Flickr"

!http://tech.karbassi.com/images/posts/2007-10-23/gbar.png(Google Photo to Flickr)!

Okay, maybe the title is a little misleading, but that's what I wanted to do. I love "Google":http://www.google.com for mostly everything, but one thing "Yahoo":http://www.yahoo.com did right was to snatch up "Flickr":http://www.flickr.com. Flickr has so much more to offer that "Picasa":http://picasaweb.google.com/ doesn't. One side note though; Flickr doesn't have a desktop photo organizer, but that's no real loss for me.

Nevertheless, I love how Google has started to add their "gbar" (Google Bar) to the top of all their applications. Even though they aren't consistent, it's nice to see, and use. After a while, I noticed myself clicking on Photo when I wanted to go to Flickr, not Picasa. Well, rather than fix my own stupid mistake and not click the link, I decided to fix the link and make it point to Flickr instead. Sorry Google, but I just enjoy Flickr more.

Here's how I did it.

*To use this script*, you need "Greasemonkey":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 add-on. Once you have it, just go here and click install: "http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13244":http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13244.

// ------------------------------------------
//
// This is a Greasemonkey user script.
//
// To install, you need Greasemonkey: http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/
// Then restart Firefox and revisit this script.
// Under Tools, there will be a new menu item to "Install User Script".
// Accept the default configuration and install.
//
// To uninstall, go to Tools/Manage User Scripts,
// select "Google Photo Link with Flickr", and click Uninstall.
//
// ------------------------------------------
//
// WHAT IT DOES:
// After the facebook profile page is loaded, it finds all the
// applications that your friends have invited you to and blocks them.
// Do not worry though, you can go to
// http://facebook.com/privacy.php?view=platform&tab=all and unblock
// them
//
// NOTE: This does not alter, delete, edit, add, or anything else to
//       your facebook profile. Just remove or disable this script and
//       everything will be displayed the same as it used to
