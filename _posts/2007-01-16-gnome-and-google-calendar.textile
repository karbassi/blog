His post is based on "Bryan Clark's":http://www.gnome.org/~clarkbw/ post on "Mashing Google Calendar and GNOME":http://www.gnome.org/~clarkbw/blog/Mashing_Google_Calendar_and_GNOME.

Let's get down to business.

First open up a @terminal@ by going to Applications @>@ Accessories @>@ Terminal (in Ubuntu) or press @Alt + F2@ and type in @terminal@. Now that you have a terminal open, let's get down to viewing your history.

Ubuntu users type:

```bash
/usr/lib/evolution-webcal/evolution-webcal $GOOGLE_ICAL_URL
```

For any other "GNOME":http://www.gnome.org/ environment:

```bash
/usr/libexec/evolution-webcal $GOOGLE_ICAL_URL
```

I hope you notice the difference.
