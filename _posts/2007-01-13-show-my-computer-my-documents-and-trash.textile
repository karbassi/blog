If you are/were a Windows user, you are used to having "My Computer", "My Documents" and/or "Recycle Bin" icons on your desktop. Well, Ubuntu can do this also. Here are 3 simple sets to do this.

# Hit ALT-F2 and type: @gconf-editor@
# Select @Apps > Nautilus > Desktop@
# Check/uncheck the boxes for @computer_icon_visible@, @documents_icon_visible@, or @trash_icon_visible@.
