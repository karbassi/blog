I just realized that I've been feeding web apps with other web apps, and all for free.

I listen to "Last.fm":http://last.fm via "sweet.fm":http://github.com/MagicMoo/SweetFM which will download my _loved_ tracks to my iTunes, that will be uploaded to "lala.com":http://lala.com with their "lala music mover":http://www.lala.com/musicmover/uploader app.

So, after a week of use, I've had over two thousand songs up on lala to be listened to anywhere at anytime.
