title: "Web Apps Feeding Web Apps"
---

I just realized that I've been feeding web apps with other web apps, and all for free.

I listen to "last.fm":http://last.fm via "sweet.fm":http://github.com/MagicMoo/SweetFM which downloads my _loved_ tracks to my iTunes; those are then matched or uploaded to "lala.com's":http://wwwlala.com catalog with their "lala music mover":http://www.lala.com/musicmover/uploader app, and finally the tracks are "scrobbled":http://www.audioscrobbler.net/ back to last.fm.

The cycle of last.fm @>@ sweet.fm @>@ iTunes @>@ lala @>@ last.fm keeps my library growing. Moreover, I get one free listen to new tracks on lala.

So after a week of using this process, I've added over two thousand songs to lala that I can listen to anywhere, anytime.
