![Saft needs to be updated to handle Safari 3.1.1]

I have always used [Webkit] ever since switching to [Safari] as my general browser. Being that I'm always getting the newest build, I know what's coming when Safari decides to upgrade.

Since [Apple updated Safari from 3.1 to 3.1.1], Saft, a wonderful "addon/plugin/what-have-you", breaks. I know Hao Li at [haoli.dnsalias.com] will be updating it pretty soon, but I have found a quick fix until that is done.

1.  Quit Safari.

2.  Navigate to `Applications/Saft.app`.

3.  Control click to show package contents.

4.  Open bundle and go to `Contents`, then `Resources`, `Saft.bundle`, and `Contents`. You're full path should be `Applications/Saft.app/Contents/Resources/Saft.bundle/Contents`.

5.  Double click or open `Info.plist` in your favorite text editor.

6.  Change `SaftSupportedSafariBuild` to `5525.18`. This is to match the current Safari version/build. It will then look like this:
    ```xml
        <key>SaftSupportedSafariBuild</key>
        <array>
        <string>5525.18</string>
        </array>
    ```

7.  Save and relaunch Safari.
