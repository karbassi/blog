It's been a long while since I've sat down and played a video game, especially on my macbook. Today I ran into a simple, yet very thought-provoking game, "Passage":http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/. Albeit, the game can be played on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  As you can see in the screenshot above, it's a 8-bit type game with simple controls. I highly suggest you play the game once, then read the "Creator's Statement":http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/statement.html. An excerpt is below:

bq. It presents an entire life, from young adulthood through old age and death, in the span of five minutes. Of course, it's a game, not a painting or a film, so the choices that you make as the player are crucial. There's no 'right' way to play Passage, just as there's no right way to interpret it.
