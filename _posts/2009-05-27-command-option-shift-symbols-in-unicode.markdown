title: Command, Option, & Shift Symbols in Unicode
---
Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

<code>? - &#x2318; - &#8984;</code> - the Command Key symbol
<code>? - &#x2325; - &#8997;</code> - the Option Key symbol
<code>? - &#x21E7; - &#8679;</code> - the Shift Key symbol
<code>? - &#x238B; - &#9099;</code> - the Power Button

**Note:** The Power Button and Shift Key are not Mac-specific. The power button is described as "broken circle with northwest arrow", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7. The shift key is described as an "outline up-arrow".

Even though these are defined in standard Unicode, there is **no guarantee** that they will exist in the font of the receiving browser, but they';re at least globally defined, so they';re fair game.
