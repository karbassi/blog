title: "Leopard: Turn off Bonjour (mDNSResponder)"
---

I recently upgrades to Leopard and the operating system has been great. After installing my core set of programs, I noticed that "mDNSResponder":http://developer.apple.com/opensource/internet/bonjour.html was going nuts. Being that I am on an university network, there are hundreds on the current sub-network. By default, Leopard has a "feature" that lists all the local computers (windows or mac) that it finds. This is called "Bonjour":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_%28software%29. You may know about this via "iChat":http://www.apple.com/ichat/, or other programs. Sure, that's nice, but does it take up +lots+ processes. Again, this would be nice upon request, but the task is done repeatedly. The load on your system just gets out of hand.

After some research, I found that there is a Launch Daemon for this. Here's how you turn it off, but don't worry, you can turn it back on anytime, without restarts or anything.

Load up Terminal (@Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app@) and type the following.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
{% endhighlight %}

To turn it back on, just do the opposite:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
{% endhighlight %}
