![Saft needs to be updated to handle Safari 3.1.1](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/2419294985_c777208f68.jpg)

I have always used [Webkit](http://webkit.org/) ever since switching to [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) as my general browser. Being that I'm always getting the newest build, I know what's coming when Safari decides to upgrade.

Since [Apple updated Safari from 3.1 to 3.1.1](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/safari311.html), Saft, a wonderful "addon/plugin/what-have-you", breaks. I know Hao Li at [haoli.dnsalias.com](http://haoli.dnsalias.com) will be updating it pretty soon, but I have found a quick fix until that is done.

1. Quit Safari.
2. Navigate to <tt>Applications/Saft.app</tt>
3. Control click to show package contents.
4. Open bundle and go to <tt>Contents</tt>, then <tt>Resources</tt>, <tt>Saft.bundle</tt>, and <tt>Contents</tt>. You're full path should be <tt>Applications/Saft.app/Contents/Resources/Saft.bundle/Contents</tt>
5. Double click or open <tt>Info.plist</tt> in your favorite text editor.
6. Change <tt>SaftSupportedSafariBuild</tt> to <tt>5525.18</tt>. This is to match the current Safari version/build.
    It will then look like this:

    &lt;key&gt;SaftSupportedSafariBuild&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;5525.18&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;

7. Save and relaunch Safari.
