---

If you are/were a Windows user, you are used to having "My Computer", "My Documents" and/or "Recycle Bin" icons on your desktop. Well, Ubuntu can do this also. Here are 3 simple sets to do this.

1. Hit ALT-F2 and type: <tt>gconf-editor</tt>
2. Select <tt>Apps > Nautilus > Desktop</tt>
3. Check/uncheck the boxes for <tt>computer_icon_visible</tt>, <tt>documents_icon_visible</tt>, or   <tt>trash_icon_visible</tt>.
