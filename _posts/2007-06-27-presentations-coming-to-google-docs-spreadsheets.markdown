title: Presentations coming to Google Docs & Spreadsheets.
---
Taking a snoop into the new ([mentioned](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/26/google-docs-gets-folders-now-what-about-gmail/) everywhere) Google Doc & Spreadsheets javascript, I found an the icon for Presentation. Presentation is basically Keynote on Mac or Powerpoint on Windows.

The Presentation icon ![Presentation Icon](http://docs.google.com/images/doclist/icon_2_pres.gif) might join the already implemented are the Google Document icon ![Document](http://docs.google.com/images/doclist/icon_2_doc.gif) and Google Spreadsheet icon ![Spreadsheet](http://docs.google.com/images/doclist/icon_2_spread.gif).

It seems Google is pushing towards the Office App that has been rumored.
