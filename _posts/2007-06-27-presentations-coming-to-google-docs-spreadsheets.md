Taking a snoop into the new ([mentioned everywhere](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/26/google-docs-gets-folders-now-what-about-gmail/\)) Google Doc & Spreadsheets javascript, I found an the icon for Presentation. Presentation is basically Keynote on Mac or Powerpoint on Windows.

The Presentation icon ![Presentation Icon](http://tech.karbassi.com/images/posts/2007-06-27/presentation.gif "Presentation Icon") might join the already implemented are the Google Document icon ![Document Icon](http://tech.karbassi.com/images/posts/2007-06-27/document.gif "Document Icon") and Google Spreadsheet icon ![Spreadsheet Icon](http://tech.karbassi.com/images/posts/2007-06-27/spreadsheet.gif "Spreadsheet Icon").

It seems Google is pushing towards the Office App that has been rumored.
