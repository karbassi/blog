!/images/posts/2008-04-16/saft.jpg(Saft needs to be updated to handle Safari 3.1.1)!

I have always used "Webkit":http://webkit.org/ ever since switching to "Safari":http://www.apple.com/safari/ as my general browser. Being that I'm always getting the newest build, I know what's coming when Safari decides to upgrade.

Since "Apple updated Safari from 3.1 to 3.1.1":http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/safari311.html, Saft, a wonderful "addon/plugin/what-have-you", breaks. I know Hao Li at "haoli.dnsalias.com":http://haoli.dnsalias.com will be updating it pretty soon, but I have found a quick fix until that is done.

# Quit Safari.
# Navigate to @Applications/Saft.app@
# Control click to show package contents.
# Open bundle and go to @Contents@, then @Resources@, @Saft.bundle@, and @Contents@. You're full path should be @Applications/Saft.app/Contents/Resources/Saft.bundle/Contents@
# Double click or open @Info.plist@ in your favorite text editor.
# Change @SaftSupportedSafariBuild@ to @5525.18@. This is to match the current Safari version/build.
It will then look like this:
<pre>
<code>
 <key>SaftSupportedSafariBuild</key>
 <array>
    <string>5525.18</string>
 </array>
</code>
</pre>
# Save and relaunch Safari.
