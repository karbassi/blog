title: "MacPorts on Snow Leopard"
---

bq. *Update: 2010* I would highly suggest moving away from MacPorts/Fink and to use "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ by "Max Howell":http://methylblue.com/.
*Update:* The nice people at MacPorts have update the package to v1.8.0. You can follow "their instructions":http://trac.macports.org/post/macports-180-now-available/ to upgrade to the latest stable version. I would suggest the "MacPorts v1.8.0 for OS X 10.6 DMG":http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.8.0-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg file.

After installing Snow Leopard, you may want to install the MacPorts. Follow the following steps to get it up and running:

1. Download and install "XCode":http://developer.apple.com/mac/ from ADC.
2. Open up the Terminal
3. @svn co http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk/base/@
4. @cd base@
5. @./configure@
6. @make@
7. @sudo make install@
8. @sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate@
9. @sudo port upgrade --enforce-variants@ (Did not work for me)
10. @sudo port upgrade outdated@ (Did not work for me)
