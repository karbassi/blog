title: "How to change bash prompt"

Some people have asked me how I changed my bash/terminal prompt from the default prompt to what I have. It's actually a very simple process.

First, load up Terminal and open up your @~/.bash_profile@ file. (FYI, be sure to read the "difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc":http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html.)

Then type the following:

{% highlight bash %}
export PS1="\w>: "
export PS2=" > "
{% endhighlight %}

There are a lot of possible things you can enter. Here are some of them that work well:

|_.Command  |_. Description                             |_. Example             |
| \a        | ASCII bell character                      | --                    |

| \\        | print a backslash                         | \                     |
