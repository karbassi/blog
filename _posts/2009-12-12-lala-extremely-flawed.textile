title: "lala extremely flawed"
---

A week ago I wrote about how I used "web apps to feed into other web apps":http://tech.karbassi.com/2009/12/08/web-apps-feeding-web-apps/, more specifically I talked about "lala":http://www.lala.com and it's ""lala music mover":http://www.lala.com/musicmover/uploader".

Recently a thought formed; while watching how lala's music mover worked, I noticed that it wasn't checking anything _other_ than the "ID3":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3 tag. I ran a real quick experiment.

To test this out, I found a song that I didn't already have. ""Fireflies":http://lala.com/zyhS" by "Owl City" seemed a great fit. I made a clean iTunes library, created a sample mp3 and added it to iTunes. Then, I just edited the ID3 tag to match some basic information about the Fireflies track. Finally I made the lala mover rescan my library. Surprisingly when I checked lala, they had added it to my library. 

What does this teach us? The lala mover does nothing but check for ID3 tags. But really, I just saved 10<notextile>&cent;</notextile>. It's not possible to download the track from lala being that they think I already own the track.
