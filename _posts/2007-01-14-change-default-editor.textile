There is a quick way to change your default editor, whichever you want.

First open up a @terminal@ by going to @Applications > Accessories > Terminal@ (in Ubuntu) or press @Alt + F2@ and type in @terminal@. Now that you have a terminal open, let's get down to viewing your history.

Open up @.bashrc@ by typing:

{% highlight bash %}
vim ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

Now to change your bash default editor find.

{% highlight bash %}
export EDITOR
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you can't find that, just add this to the top.

{% highlight bash %}
export EDITOR=vim
{% endhighlight %}

Personally I like @vim@. You can use @pico@ (@/usr/bin/pico@), @nano@ (@/usr/bin/nano@), or any other editor you like.

Like always, you can learn more about this by doing the following:

{% highlight bash %}
man bash
{% endhighlight %}
