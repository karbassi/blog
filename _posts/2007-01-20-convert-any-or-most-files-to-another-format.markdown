title: Convert any (or most) files to another format
---

So, I was stuck with an OpenOffice text document (<tt>.odt</tt>) and the place were I was at didn't have OpenOffice. They were using a Microsoft Office version (2000/XP I believe). What was I to do? A presentation due and I had no way of accessing my files.

[Media Convert](http://media-convert.com/) to the rescue. Yes, I know I sound like an advertisement, but this website has saved me multiple times. With just an internet connection, I can convert a OpenOffice Text Document to a <tt>.doc</tt> in a few seconds.
