Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

&\#x2318; - `&#x2318;` - `&#8984;` - the Command Key symbol
&\#x2325; - `&#x2325;` - `&#8997;` - the Option Key symbol
&\#x21E7; - `&#x21E7;` - `&#8679;` - the Shift Key symbol
&\#x238B; - `&#x238B;` - `&#9099;` - the ESC Key symbol
&\#x21ea; - `&#x21ea;` - `&#8682;` - the Capslock symbol
&\#x23ce; - `&#x23ce;` - `&#9166;` - the Return symbol
&\#x232b; - `&#x232b;` - `&#9003;` - the Delete / Backspace symbol

**Note:** The Power Button and Shift Key are not Mac-specific. The power button is described as "broken circle with northwest arrow", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7. The shift key is described as an "outline up-arrow".

Even though these are defined in standard Unicode, there is **no guarantee** that they will exist in the font of the receiving browser, but they're at least globally defined, so they're fair game.
