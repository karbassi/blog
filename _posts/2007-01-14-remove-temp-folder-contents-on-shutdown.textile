title: "Remove temp folder contents on shutdown"
---

A few days ago Codejacked wrote an article talking about "Delete your TEMP files on shutdown":http://www.codejacked.com/delete-your-temp-files-on-shutdown/ for Windows. As much as I loved the article, I have recently switched over to "Ubuntu":http://www.ubuntu.com. Like all operating systems, GNU Linux has temporary files also. Here's how to delete them on shutdown.

# Back up what you're going to working on.

    {% highlight bash %}
    sudo cp /etc/init.d/sysklogd /etc/init.d/sysklogd_backup
    {% endhighlight %}

# Open the file in @gedit@

    {% highlight bash %}
    gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/sysklogd
    {% endhighlight %}

# Find the following section

    {% highlight bash %}
    ...
    stop)
    log_begin_msg "Stopping system log daemon..."
    start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --oknodo --exec $binpath --pidfile $pidfile
    log_end_msg $?
    ...
    {% endhighlight %}

# Add the following line after @log_end_msg $?@ or before @;;@.

    {% highlight bash %}
    rm -fr /tmp/* /tmp/.??*
    {% endhighlight %}

# Save the file and you're set!
