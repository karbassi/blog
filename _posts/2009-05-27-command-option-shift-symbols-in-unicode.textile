title: "Command, Option, & Shift Symbols in Unicode"

Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

⌘ - @&#x2318; - &#8984;@ - the Command Key symbol
⌥ - @&#x2325; - &#8997;@ - the Option Key symbol
⇧ - @&#x21E7; - &#8679;@ - the Shift Key symbol
⎋ - @&#x238B; - &#9099;@ - the Power Button

*Note:* The Power Button and Shift Key are not Mac-specific. The power button is described as "broken circle with northwest arrow", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7. The shift key is described as an "outline up-arrow".

Even though these are defined in standard Unicode, there is *no guarantee* that they will exist in the font of the receiving browser, but they're at least globally defined, so they're fair game.
