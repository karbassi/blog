title: "Command, Option, & Shift Symbols in Unicode"

bq. *Update:* Ratty in the comment noted that <notextile>&#x238B;</notextile> is actually the ESC key button not the power button.
*Update 2012:* Added more symbols.

Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

<notextile>&#x2318;</notextile> - @&#x2318;@ - @&#8984;@ - the Command Key symbol
<notextile>&#x2325;</notextile> - @&#x2325;@ - @&#8997;@ - the Option Key symbol
<notextile>&#x21E7;</notextile> - @&#x21E7;@ - @&#8679;@ - the Shift Key symbol
<notextile>&#x238B;</notextile> - @&#x238B;@ - @&#9099;@ - the ESC Key symbol
<notextile>&#x21ea;</notextile> - @&#x21ea;@ - @&#8682;@ - the Capslock symbol
<notextile>&#x23ce;</notextile> - @&#x23ce;@ - @&#9166;@ - the Return symbol
<notextile>&#x232b;</notextile> - @&#x232b;@ - @&#9003;@ - the Delete / Backspace symbol


*Note:* The Power Button and Shift Key are not Mac-specific. The power button is described as "broken circle with northwest arrow", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7. The shift key is described as an "outline up-arrow".

Even though these are defined in standard Unicode, there is *no guarantee* that they will exist in the font of the receiving browser, but they're at least globally defined, so they're fair game.
