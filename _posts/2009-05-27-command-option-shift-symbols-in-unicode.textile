title: "Command, Option, & Shift Symbols in Unicode"

Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

&#x2318; - @&#x2318&#59; - &#8984&#59;@ - the Command Key symbol
&#x2325; - @&#x2325&#59; - &#8997&#59;@ - the Option Key symbol
&#x21E7; - @&#x21E7&#59; - &#8679&#59;@ - the Shift Key symbol
&#x238B; - @&#x238B&#59; - &#9099&#59;@ - the Power Button

*Note:* The Power Button and Shift Key are not Mac-specific. The power button is described as "broken circle with northwest arrow", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7. The shift key is described as an "outline up-arrow".

Even though these are defined in standard Unicode, there is *no guarantee* that they will exist in the font of the receiving browser, but they're at least globally defined, so they're fair game.
