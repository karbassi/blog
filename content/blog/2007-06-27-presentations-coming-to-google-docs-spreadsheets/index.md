Taking a snoop into the new ([mentioned everywhere]) Google Doc & Spreadsheets javascript, I found an the icon for Presentation. Presentation is basically Keynote on Mac or Powerpoint on Windows.

The Presentation icon ![Presentation Icon] might join the already implemented are the Google Document icon ![Document Icon] and Google Spreadsheet icon ![Spreadsheet Icon].

It seems Google is pushing towards the Office App that has been rumored.
