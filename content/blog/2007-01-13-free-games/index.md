Who doesn't love games? There are many amazing games out there that you have to pay for, but why would you when you have FREE ones that are as amazing? I decided to keep an on-going list of free games (usually under Ubuntu GNU Linux).

## [Neverball]

```bash
sudo aptitude install neverball
```

## [Tremulous]

```bash
sudo aptitude install tremulous
```
