title: "Web Apps Feeding Web Apps"

I just realized that I've been feeding web apps with other web apps, and all for free.

I listen to [last.fm] via [sweet.fm] which downloads my _loved_ tracks to my iTunes; those are then matched or uploaded to [lala.com's] catalog with their [lala music mover] app, and finally the tracks are [scrobbled] back to last.fm.

The cycle of last.fm `>` sweet.fm `>` iTunes `>` lala `>` last.fm keeps my library growing. Moreover, I get one free listen to new tracks on lala.

So after a week of using this process, I've added over two thousand songs to lala that I can listen to anywhere, anytime.
